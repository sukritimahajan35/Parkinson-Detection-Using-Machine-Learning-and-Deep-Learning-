# Parkinson-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-
Using text-based and image-based datasets, deep learning and machine learning techniques are used to identify Parkinson’s condition early.


Used a variety of ML algorithms, such as SVM, DT, XGBoost, Random Forest, Naive
Bayes, Stacking Classifier (Decision Tree and XGBoost as base models and logistic regression
as a metamodel) and Voting classifier for the classification dataset. For the Regression dataset
models such as Linear Regression (LR), Lasso Regression (Lasso), Ridge Regression (Ridge),
SVM Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression (CART), KNN Regression were used. ML
models demonstrate significant utility in managing various forms of data and uncovering intricate patterns within datasets linked to Parkinson’s disease.
The study examines efficacy of DL algorithms in illness identification addition to ML. In
particular, it made use of InceptionV3, MobileNet, and a basic Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) architecture.
In the proposed work, a dataset comprising several aspects associated with Parkinson’s disease, such as biomedical meaurements, telemonitoring dataset, image drawings, were used to
train these ML and DL models. Standard measures including the precison, accuracy, recall,
f1-score were employed for evaluating each model’s performance in accurately classifying individuals as either Parkinson’s disease patients or healthy controls.
