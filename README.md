# Parkinson-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-
Using text-based and image-based datasets, deep learning and machine learning techniques are used to identify Parkinson’s condition early.


Used a variety of ML algorithms, such as SVM, DT, XGBoost, Random Forest, Naive
Bayes, Stacking Classifier (Decision Tree and XGBoost as base models and logistic regression
as a metamodel) and Voting classifier for the classification dataset. 

For the Regression dataset
models such as Linear Regression (LR), Lasso Regression (Lasso), Ridge Regression (Ridge),
SVM Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression (CART), KNN Regression were used. 

For Deep Learning used InceptionV3, MobileNet, and a basic Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) architecture.

In the proposed work, a dataset comprising several aspects associated with Parkinson’s disease, such as biomedical meaurements, telemonitoring dataset, image drawings, were used to
train these ML and DL models.
